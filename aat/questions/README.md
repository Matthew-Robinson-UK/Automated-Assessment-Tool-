# Tasks to complete for questions CRUD

- [x] Migrate routes over to questions blueprint
- [x] Update db_maker to include some "floating" questions
- [ ] Add proper delete functionality for individual questions
- [ ] Add many to many table so that questions can be on multiple assessments (nice to have)
- [x] Add filters to questions index page, i.e. show only floating questions or show by difficulty
- [ ] Add proper auth/permissions
